# MVP

My pipeline for the project is: 

- Data acquisition from API to SQL database
- Data preprocessing
- Dash application for Dashboard

After creating a pipeline for data acquisition and preprocessing, I made a dashboard for visualizing the data with Dash Plotly using the static dataset.

I scheduled the cron job to update the dataset on a daily basis since the source updates data everyday.

Next, I will do more Data visualization on the dashboard and hopefully deploy the dashboard app to Heroku.
